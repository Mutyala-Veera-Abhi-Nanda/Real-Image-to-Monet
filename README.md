# Real Image to Monet using CycleGAN:

This repository contains a project that uses CycleGAN to transform real images into Monet-style paintings. The project involves loading a dataset, preprocessing the data, building and training a CycleGAN model, and generating Monet-style images from real photos.

## Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is sourced from a Kaggle dataset, specifically designed for GAN projects.

## Requirements:

To run this project, you'll need the following libraries:

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- pandas
- tensorflow
- tensorflow-addons
- matplotlib
- PIL (Pillow)

You can install these libraries using pip:

code: 

pip install numpy pandas tensorflow tensorflow-addons matplotlib pillow

## Usage:

#### 1. Clone the Repository:

code:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Real-Image-to-Monet-using-CycleGAN.git

cd Real-Image-to-Monet-using-CycleGAN

#### 2. Prepare the Data

Ensure the dataset is downloaded and placed in the appropriate directory. 

You can modify the data paths in the notebook as needed.

#### 3. Run the Notebook

Open the Jupyter notebook and run the cells sequentially to train the model and generate Monet-style images.

## Key Sections in the Notebook:

#### Import TensorFlow Packages:

Import necessary libraries and packages.

#### Dataset Configuration:

Set up dataset paths and parameters.

#### Data Preprocessing:

Load and preprocess images for training.

#### Model Building:

Define the CycleGAN model architecture.

#### Training:

Train the CycleGAN model with the dataset.

#### Evaluation:

Generate Monet-style images from real photos.

## Results:

After training the model, you can evaluate its performance by generating Monet-style images from real photos. The generated images can be visualized using matplotlib.

## Example:

Hereâ€™s an example of a generated Monet-style image:

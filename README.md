# Real Image to Monet using CycleGAN:

This repository contains a project that uses CycleGAN to transform real images into Monet-style paintings. The project involves loading a dataset, preprocessing the data, building and training a CycleGAN model, and generating Monet-style images from real photos.

## Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is sourced from a Kaggle dataset, specifically designed for GAN projects.

## Requirements:

To run this project, you'll need the following libraries:

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- pandas
- tensorflow
- tensorflow-addons
- matplotlib
- PIL (Pillow)

You can install these libraries using pip:

code: 

pip install numpy pandas tensorflow tensorflow-addons matplotlib pillow

## Usage:

#### 1. Clone the Repository:

code:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Real-Image-to-Monet-using-CycleGAN.git

cd Real-Image-to-Monet-using-CycleGAN

#### 2. Prepare the Data
Ensure the dataset is downloaded and placed in the appropriate directory. You can modify the data paths in the notebook as needed.

#### 3. Run the Notebook
Open the Jupyter notebook and run the cells sequentially to train the model and generate Monet-style images.
